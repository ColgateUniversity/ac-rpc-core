# Assignment Calculator / Research Project Calculator

## No longer being maintained
This version of the Assignment Calculator / Research Project Calculator served
the needs of Minitex and the Univ. of Minnesota for more than 8 years, but the
time has come to retire the codebase.

In summer 2017 we reimplemented the most-used features of the Assignment
Calculator inside our CMS platrofm at https://www.lib.umn.edu/ac.  We will not
be making further updates to this repository.

The [`experimental` branch](https://github.com/ac-rpc/ac-rpc-core/tree/experimental) contains the
most up to date code, with security improvements, a full implementation of the
PDO database abstraction extension, and considerably more unit testing.
Although we consider the implementation complete, the `experimental` branch had
not been tested thoroughly enough for our production use.
